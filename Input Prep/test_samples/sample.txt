This is a sample text document for testing the LLM-Protect input preparation system.

The system should extract this text, chunk it appropriately, and sign each chunk with an HMAC.

This document tests basic TXT file processing capabilities.

The chunking algorithm should split this into manageable pieces while preserving context.

Each chunk will be signed independently to ensure data integrity throughout the pipeline.
